# ✨ My Practice Coding Project

This is a simple airline reservation system built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project includes:

## ✨ Features
- **Reserve a seat**  
- **Change a seat**  
- **Cancel a seat**  
- **Show ticket details**  

This project is part of my coding practice after a break. While it's complete, there’s still room for improvement! ✨
